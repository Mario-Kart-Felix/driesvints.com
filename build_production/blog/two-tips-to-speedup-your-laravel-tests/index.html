        <h1>Two tips to speedup your Laravel tests</h1>

        <blockquote>
<p>This optimization has since <a href="https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/6806aaa3568382e9c8c7281a64b82a52b824e46f/phpunit.xml#L27">made it into the core</a> of the framework. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've seen two different tips for speeding up your tests in Laravel in the past week and thought I'd share them with you. For me, they made a significant impact on the speed of my tests.</p>
<h2>Lower the default crypt cost factor</h2>
<p>This is a huge time saver. <a href="https://twitter.com/codebyjeff">Jeff Madsen</a> recently showed us a tip in one of his <a href="http://codebyjeff.com/newsletter">Laravel Quick Tips newsletter</a> which speeds up your tests by lowering the default crypt cost factor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ordinarily when you need to do a lot of testing with an object that can take a non-trivial amount of time to create, you just mock it. For example - creating a user is not just a matter of writing to databse, but it also has a relatively expensive password hashing process to go through. If your test count is still low this may not seem like a big deal, but when it grows and is run via Jenkins or Travis or similar, it can really slow things down. A mock lets you skip that, and save time.</p>
<p>However, there will be times where you may be forced to go through the actual User create process, such as in integration tests. In that case, this tip can be handy.</p>
<p>In your TestCase.php file, add this line about hashing rounds:</p>
<pre><code>public function createApplication()
{
    $app = require __DIR__.'/../bootstrap/app.php';

    $app-&gt;make(Illuminate\Contracts\Console\Kernel::class)-&gt;bootstrap();

    // add this line
    Hash::setRounds(5);

    return $app;
}</code></pre>
<p>This cuts the number of rounds from the default of 10 down to 5, shaving about half or even more of the time spent hashing. A big saving when you are running dozens of tests all day long!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, this cut the time to run the new Laravel.io's test suite almost by half. Sweet!</p>
<h2>Use a precomputed hash in your factories</h2>
<p>Another tip is one which was recently added by <a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a> in the Laravel skeleton: <a href="https://github.com/laravel/laravel/pull/3894">https://github.com/laravel/laravel/pull/3894</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use a precomputed hash of the word &quot;secret&quot; instead of using <code>bcrypt</code> directly. Since <code>bcrypt</code> is intentionally slow, it can really slow down test suites in large applications that use factories to generate models in many tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This additionally cut off some time to run the new Laravel.io test suite. So all in all these two tips made my test suite run twice as fast.</p>
