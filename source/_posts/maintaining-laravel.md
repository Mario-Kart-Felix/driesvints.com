A lot of people might wonder what it is to maintain a big open-source project like Laravel and all of its open-source libraries. In this video I'll take you through my daily routine of handling issues and also give you a few tips when posting issues. After the video you'll have a better understanding on what's involved in the process and how time consuming it can be.

There's quite a long intro at the beginning so if you immediately want to start watching at the point when I start handling issues tune in here: [https://youtu.be/a8xAxLzIFs8?t=767](https://youtu.be/a8xAxLzIFs8?t=767) (at 12:47)
