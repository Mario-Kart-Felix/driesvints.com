I changed the name again! Will this be the last time? Probably not!

I'll be tweeting these posts with #laravelweekly from now on. I also have a couple of ideas in mind for future editions for these posts. Stay tuned :)

Again, if you'd like to see your resources, packages, articles, you name it in these posts, just mention them to me on twitter or email me.<!--more-->

## What Happened To The StackExchange Proposal?

In short: [it got rejected](http://discuss.area51.stackexchange.com/questions/10046/no-really-what-part-of-this-isnt-already-on-topic-for-stack-overflow). The people at [Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com/) didn't feel that a separate site for Laravel was needed at this time and pointed out that StackOverflow already provided a platform that we could use.

Now this isn't a bad thing. Like they said, we can use StackOverflow for now which is still a great platform to ask questions. Just tag your posts with #laravel. It won't be a separate Laravel platform but it basically still is the same thing.

Thanks to everyone who voted and helped out, we really appreciate it!

## Laravel 4: Maintenance Mode

A recent addition in Laravel 4 beta 5 is the ability to set your application into maintenance mode through Artisan. This gives you a nice way to upgrade or tinker with your app while cutting off user interaction to it.

## Laravel 4: Soft Delete

https://twitter.com/laravelphp/status/330328333332127745

Soft deleting a record means that you're deleting a record without actually removing it from the database. This can be handy in quite some cases where you have relationships defined which you don't want to lose after deleting a record.

You can learn more about soft deleting records at [the Laravel 4 docs](http://four.laravel.com/docs/eloquent#soft-deleting).

## Laravel 4: Generate Controllers In Subdirs

https://twitter.com/jeffrey_way/status/330347895742160897

When generating controllers through Artisan, you can now generate them inside subdirs by specifing a subdir or namespace before your controller name. When specifing a namespace, the namespace will be added automatically to the file.
