Another week, another issue. I've got something special in mind for #10. Might be that next week's issue will be in a slightly different format than the one you're reading now. Very excited about that.

Laravel 4's release date has been set for next week Tuesday. We can almost start using it to build applications which will be stable for production.

There's a lot of cool stuff happening for Laravel in the upcoming weeks. I'll try to keep you guys up-to-date on everything that's happening in Laraland.<!--more-->

## Laravel Gittip Community

[Maksim Surguy](https://twitter.com/msurguy) started [a Laravel Gittip community](https://www.gittip.com/for/laravel/). It still needs about 138 more members before it gets accepted.

Now, [what is Gittip exactly?](https://www.gittip.com/about/) Gittip allows you to give small weekly cash gifts to people who you want to support for their efforts. For example, you could tip Taylor $1 a week for his work on Laravel. It's a small amount but when a lot of people do this it could help him a lot to continue his work. And this goes for everyone who's doing free open-source work.
